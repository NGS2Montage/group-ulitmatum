# How to run

To get started developing, run `pip install -r requirements/local.txt` first (probably in a virtualenv).

This project loads configuration from a `.env` file. Because this file might contain secrets it should be distributed separately from the git repository. If you just want to get running locally copy the provided `.env.sample` to `.env`.
